			LoCO AUV is a Low-Cost Open-source Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) designed to
			perform research in marine environments. <br>
            Corey helped design and build LoCO as part of a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program (see Experience). <br>
			Notable features include hardware synced cameras in each tube providing stereo imaging which is processed in realtime using
            the on-board NVIDIA Jetson TX2 SoC. Additionally, LED "eyes" and an upward facing OLED display enable robot-human interaction.
            Numerous research projects at the IRVLab at the University of Minnesota
            have utilized LoCO, including:
                        <li>Diver following</li>
                        <li>Diver recognition and reidentification</li>

				<h3>ROS Docker</h3>
				<p>
				    The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the foundation of many robot software applications in industry and academia.
                    However, ROS configurations tend to be robot specific, which makes it difficult to develop
                    code on a personal computer and transfer it to a robot, since the machines may vary in CPU architecture,
                    operating system, and software packages.
                    Corey maintains Docker images pre-configured with ROS, system drivers, and software packages, which are
                    compatible across lab robots and personal computers. Docker image creation is automated with GitHub hooks
                    and a Jenkins CI pipeline.

				<h3>PCGCTF</h3>
				<p>
				    Procedural Content Generation for Capture The Flag Competitions (PCGCTF) is a complete system
                    designed to train users on how to test the security of computer systems. Capture the Flag (CTF) games
                    are popular in the computer security community and teach players how to break into a computer system
                    in order to capture secret information. Players must gather data and analyze a system for potential
                    exploits, execute the exploit, then exfiltrate the secret information.<br>
                    CTF games are typically hand-crafted due to their complexity. However, PCGCTF utilizes procedural content
                    generation techniques to generate a CTF game automatically with varying difficulties and exploits.
                    Corey was awarded an Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) project at UMD, where he built the system
                    and ran experiments with a dozen participants in order to test the effectiveness of PCGCTF
                    as a teaching tool.

                <h3>Air Force Research Labs Senior Design Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) holds a university design competition each year to design and build a
                    system to solve a specific task. Corey opted to join UMD's Senior Design Project team competing in this
                    design challenge and helped build the wall-climbing Sensor Deployment Rover. A total of nine students
                    and four faculty members worked on this semester-long project and presented their report to AFRL
                    members at the end of the semester. <br>
                    Corey's main contribution was designing and programming the software control stack, which included
                    developing:
                    <li>Ground-to-wall transition capabilities</li>
                    <li>An automatic thrust-vectoring control module</li>

			<h3>Gin Rummy Card Playing AI</h3>
			<p>
                During his time at SIFT, Corey worked with a few of his fellow interns to create an AI to compete
                in the <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/games/ginrummy/eaai/">Gin Rummy EAAI Undergraduate Research Challenge</a>.
			<br>AI researchers have studied games like poker and chess,
			but the card game Gin Rummy has been largely untouched. The objective of the EAAI research 
			challenge is to engage undergraduate students in the research life-cycle, from research 
			and testing to publication and presentation.
			<br><br>Corey's prior knowledge of Gin Rummy aided his contributions to the project, which included formulation of playing strategies
            of the agent, agent testing, and a written portion of the paper submission to EAAI. <br><br> See "Publications" for paper.

                <h3>Bookend</h3>
                <p>
                    Bookend is an electronic library management tool aimed to make classroom library management easier for
                    elementary school educators. Teachers typically have hundreds of books in their library, with many books lent out to their students at a time.
                    Some teachers use spreadsheets to keep track of their library, but constantly updating a spreadsheet is
                    time-consuming and can lead to confusion. <br><br>

                    Students can easily check in and out books with a library card and barcode scanner using an accessible interface.
                    Teachers can add new books with a barcode scanner, add students, import books from a .csv file, view
                    books checked out to students, and much more. <br><br>
